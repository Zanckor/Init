## Hi! I'm Zanckor ðŸ‘‹

I have been developing mods for Minecraft for about a year. During this time, I have worked on personal projects and fixed bugs in other projects. I have experience with various dependencies such as GeckoLib, TerraBlender, CrayFish GunMod, and I have also created my own library.

## Areas of Experience

Here are some areas in which I have experience:

- Custom Items/Blocks
- Entity Creation (with and without using GeckoLib)
- Custom biome creation with TerraBlender + Placed Features + Structure Generation
- UI/UX Creation
- Custom Recipes
- JSON Management
- Loot Table, Placed Features...
- Particles
- Data Management (Saved Data, Capabilities, Persistent Data...)
- Event handling + Custom Events

## Projects and Contributions

I have worked on several projects, including QuestAPI, whose code is public. I am currently working on the development of DragonCubeZ and AtmospheriCraft, both of which are in progress. I have also contributed to resolving code errors in Stabx Modern Guns. You can find the projects and their respective links below:
